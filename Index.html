    <p>My name is Jackson. I can solve rubik's cube. I can one solve one in about 20 on average.I have memorize about 300 Algorithms.I also know how to solve any cube from 2x2 to 10x10 cubes I can solve bigger cubes but after 10x10 it will take a lot longer. I also make coffee. I use a pour over method which I use hario v60.I always use lighter roasted beans as it retains the most caffine. I use 40:60 ratio as I find that it is last the longest with out feeling a caffine crash. I ussaly get about 800 milgarms of caffine a day I have tried to stop taking in less caffine.So I have tried method like putting tabaso on my eyes which works well for about 1 hour because afterward the burn disapears and I also found put water make it last about 15 minutes as there is more tabsco is spread out. The pain of putting hot scause in your eyes is shocking mangable. </p>
